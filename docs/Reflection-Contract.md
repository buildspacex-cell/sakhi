Sakhi Reflection Contract v3
(Single, coherent weekly reflection)

Purpose

Sakhi’s weekly reflection is a single, coherent piece of writing, spoken as a loving witness to the user’s lived week.

It is not a summary, not an analysis, and not segmented into dimensions.
It is a human mirror — grounded in real episodes, shaped by memory, and expressed in natural language.

All truth comes from journals and algorithmic memory.
All voice comes from the LLM.
These must never collapse into each other.

Core Architectural Invariant (Non-Negotiable)

Language never becomes memory.
Memory never becomes language.

Concretely:

Reflections are read-only

Reflections are ephemeral

Reflections are not embedded

Reflections do not update memory, patterns, or identity

What Remains Exactly the Same (Important)

All existing capture and intelligence layers continue unchanged:

Raw journals / voice logs (immutable)

Short-term memory writes

Weekly signal aggregation

Role density detection

Body / emotion / energy signals (internal only)

Longitudinal pattern detection

Confidence / sparsity signals

These layers inform the reflection.
They do not appear in it.

Reflection Grounding Rules
1. Episode-Anchored Truth (Required)

Every reflection must be grounded in specific lived episodes from the journals.

The LLM may paraphrase experience, but may not invent:

events

victories

emotional balance

causes

lessons

If an idea cannot be traced back to journal content, it must not appear.

2. Pattern Awareness as Constraint Only

Pattern awareness may:

influence which episodes are surfaced

influence what must be named

influence tone boundaries

Pattern awareness may not:

be explained

be summarized

be referenced as “a pattern”

appear directly in the reflection

Patterns are non-linguistic signals, never prose.

3. No Advice, No Coaching, No Causality

The reflection must not:

recommend actions

imply what should change

explain why things happened

frame growth or lessons

Explicitly disallowed language (non-exhaustive):

should / need to / must

took a back seat

led to / caused / resulted in

lesson / growth / learning

on the bright side

ups and downs / mixed experiences

silver lining

4. Preserve Emotional Asymmetry

Weeks are not assumed to be balanced.

If the week was heavy with brief grounding moments, that imbalance must remain.

The reflection must not redeem, soften, or counterweight the week unless the user explicitly did so.

5. Person-Level Reflection (Not Event Recap)

The reflection must describe how the week was lived, not what happened.

No timeline, no day-by-day recounting.

Light anchoring is allowed only to support recognition
(e.g., “across caregiving, work, and startup responsibilities”).

Tone Contract — “Loving Witness”
What “Loving” Means Here

Radically on the user’s side

Attentive to effort and cost

Non-neutral about the user’s worth

What It Does Not Mean

Praise

Positivity

Reassurance

Optimism

Emotional smoothing

Care shows up in word choice, not in invented hope.

Allowed Warm Language (Whitelist)

carried

held

kept going

stayed with

moved through

had little space

Disallowed Narrative Language (Blacklist)

ups and downs

mixed but

small victories

despite / but there were

balance

on the bright side

Shape of the Reflection (Single Whole)

The reflection should feel like:

one continuous voice

one emotional posture

one piece of recognition

Not sections.
Not categories.
Not analysis.

Failure Handling

If any rule is violated:

Reject the reflection

Regenerate with stricter constraints

Never partially pass
