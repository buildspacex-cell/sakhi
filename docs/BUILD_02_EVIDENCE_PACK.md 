# BUILD_02 — Evidence Pack

### Recognition Before Insight (Inner Human Mirror Core)

This document defines **Build 02 of Phase-2**: the **Evidence Pack**.

The Evidence Pack is the layer that turns Sakhi from *“intelligently reflective”* into *“undeniably accurate.”*

It exists to solve one problem:

> **Insight without recognition does not create trust.**

---

## 1. Canonical Purpose

The Evidence Pack ensures that **every non-trivial reflection Sakhi offers is grounded in lived, recognizable reality**.

Before Sakhi:

* reframes
* expands
* questions
* names a pattern

It must first be able to say:

> *“Here is what you actually lived — this is why I’m seeing this.”*

This is **not explanation**.
This is **recognition**.

---

## 2. What the Evidence Pack Is (And Is Not)

### It **IS**

* deterministic
* time-grounded
* human-readable
* minimal (1–3 anchors)
* pre-interpretive

### It **IS NOT**

* advice
* insight
* diagnosis
* narrative framing
* persuasion

If an Evidence Pack feels “clever,” it is wrong.

---

## 3. Position in the Architecture

```
Memory
  ↓
Pattern / Narrative / Rhythm Engines
  ↓
Evidence Pack   ← (THIS BUILD)
  ↓
Deliberation Scaffold
  ↓
Reflection & Language
```

**Key rule:**
Evidence Pack always precedes insight.

---

## 4. Inputs (What This Build Consumes)

The Evidence Pack **does not introduce new signals**.

It uses existing data only:

### Primary Sources

* `memory_episodic`
* `episodes` (legacy overlap)
* `bridging_reflections`
* `daily_reflection_cache`
* `context_recalls`

### Supporting Signals

* salience scores
* recurrence counts
* narrative phase markers
* confidence metrics from pattern engines

---

## 5. Output: EvidencePack Object (Canonical Shape)

The Evidence Pack is an **ephemeral object**, injected into turn context.

```json
EvidencePack = {
  "pattern_label": "string | null",
  "confidence": 0.0 - 1.0,
  "anchors": [
    {
      "when": "ISO timestamp or relative time",
      "what_happened": "plain human language",
      "why_it_matters": "signal-level relevance (not interpretation)",
      "recurrence_or_contrast": "recurring | contrast | inflection"
    }
  ],
  "sources_used": ["episodic", "daily", "narrative"],
  "selection_reason": "salience | recurrence | contrast"
}
```

---

## 6. Anchor Selection Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Quantity

* Minimum: **1**
* Maximum: **3**
* Default: **2**

More than 3 dilutes recognition.

---

### Ranking Logic (Deterministic)

Anchors are selected using a weighted score:

```
anchor_score =
  (salience * 0.4)
+ (recency * 0.2)
+ (recurrence * 0.2)
+ (narrative_relevance * 0.2)
```

No LLM involvement.

---

### Language Rules

* First-person framing allowed (“you noticed…”, “you shared…”)
* No abstraction
* No labels
* No conclusions
* No emotional adjectives beyond what user expressed

---

## 7. What “Why It Matters” Means (Important)

`why_it_matters` **does not explain the user**.

It explains **signal relevance** only.

✅ Correct:

> “This came up during a week where energy dipped and priorities conflicted.”

❌ Incorrect:

> “This shows avoidance behavior.”

---

## 8. Storage & Lifecycle

### Persistence

* **Not written** to long-term memory
* **Not written** to personal_model
* May be optionally logged in `debug_traces` for replay

### Lifetime

* Valid for a single turn
* Recomputed freely
* Disposable

---

## 9. Who Can Use the Evidence Pack

### Allowed Consumers

* Deliberation Scaffold
* Reflection / Language layer
* Reflection Trace (Build 04)

### Forbidden Uses

* Task mutation
* Identity updates
* Scoring or ranking the person
* Behavioral nudging

---

## 10. Failure Modes to Guard Against

This build fails if:

* Evidence sounds like interpretation ❌
* Anchors feel cherry-picked ❌
* Language feels persuasive ❌
* Sakhi proceeds to insight without surfacing evidence ❌

---

## 11. Definition of “Done”

This build is complete when:

* Users respond with **recognition**, not surprise
  (“Yes — that’s exactly what happened.”)
* Disagreement feels safe
  (“That doesn’t feel like the right example.”)
* Reflection feels grounded before it feels insightful
* Trust increases even when insight is uncomfortable

---

## 12. Codex Execution Instructions (High-Level)

**Ask Codex to:**

1. Implement `select_evidence_anchors()` engine
2. Enforce anchor ranking + caps
3. Produce EvidencePack object per turn
4. Inject EvidencePack into `/v2/turn` context (read-only)
5. Add unit tests for:

   * recurrence selection
   * contrast detection
   * recency bias
   * low-confidence fallback

---

## 13. Canonical Law

> **If Sakhi cannot show the lived evidence,
> it is not allowed to show the insight.**

This rule protects trust.
